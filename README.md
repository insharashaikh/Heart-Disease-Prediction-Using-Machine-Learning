# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project is an end-to-end ML classification system to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on key medical and health attributes. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the complete ML workflow, starting from data exploration to model evaluation, while applying core data science and machine learning concepts.
